The Software is licensed to You on a per application basis. In order to use or continue using the Software, you are required to purchase and maintain current a License in accordance with the Pair Pricing Schedule. You must contact Pair at contact@pair3d.com for additional License Pricing. 
1.  DEFINITIONS. As used in this Agreement or the Pair Pricing Schedule (as defined below), the following terms shall have the following meanings:
“App Install” means a single installation of a Developer Application on a single device. For the avoidance of doubt, if You install a Developer Application on the same device twice it counts as two App Installs.
“Camera View” or “camera view” means an image from a device’s camera viewfinder screen that is automatically captured by the Developer Application and provided to the Software.
“Developer Application” means a software application that is developed by You or on Your behalf hereunder using the Software and Services to incorporate visual recognition capabilities. All current versions and all future versions of such software application across all operating systems (e.g. Android, iOS, Universal Windows Platform etc.) that have the same name (or a minor variation of the name) and have substantially similar functionality shall be considered to be a single Developer Application under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an application that is developed for both mobile devices and digital eyewear will be treated as two separate Developer Applications and will require two License Keys.
“License Key” means a unique key specific to a particular Developer Application that enables the use of the Software in the Developer Application.
“Permitted Use” means use of the Software and Services as development tools to enable the testing, development and distribution of Your visual recognition end-user Developer Applications in accordance with Your applicable License, as more particularly described in the Documentation. 
“Services” means the Pair system and services made available to You by Pair Inc. for use in connection with Developer Applications, which may include, without limitation, the services available through the Developer Portal, the Pair API, and other related features and functionality of the Pair platform.
“Software” means the software described in the list in Section 3.1, and additional software, if any, that Pair Inc. provides pursuant to Section 3.5 (Additional Software).
2.   LICENSE TERMS. Except as otherwise permitted herein, You are required to purchase a License Key for the Software and Services. 
License Keys. You acknowledge and agree that each Developer Application must use a unique License Key to (i) access the Software and Services. Pair may, in its sole discretion decline to provide You License Keys or access to the Software, for any reason or no reason.  Pair has the right to monitor Your Developer Application(s) and use of the License Key(s) to ensure they are not employed except for the Permitted Use. If employed for other than the Permitted Use, Pair has the right to immediately revoke the License Key(s) and Your license to the Software. You shall not sell, transfer or sublicense Your License Keys to any person or entity.
Permitted Use.  Subject to and conditioned upon compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Pair Inc. hereby permits You to use and access the Software and/or Services during the term of this Agreement solely for the Permitted Use. You are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws governing access to and provision of the Services in Your Developer Application(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pair Inc. reserves the right to modify the Software and the Services with or without notice.
Account Credentials.  You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your password protected access to the Services. Except as set forth below, You shall not distribute Your password or otherwise allow third parties to access the password protected features of the Services using Your password. You may share your account credentials, including Your password, with a contractor for the sole purpose of assisting You in developing and testing a Developer Application on Your behalf provided that such contractor (a) has an active and valid Pair developer account with Pair Inc. and an active agreement with Pair Inc. similar to these terms governing the contractor’s access to and use of the Software and Services, (b) has a need to access Your account to assist in developing and testing the Developer Application, and (c) has a written and binding agreement with You to protect the unauthorized use and disclosure of Confidential Information (as defined in Section 5 (Confidentiality)). You are responsible for maintaining appropriate security, protection, and backup for Your user account, Targets and other Content and License Keys and for all activities that occur under or are otherwise associated with Your account. You shall notify Pair Inc. immediately of any unauthorized use of any License Keys or any other known or suspected breach of security of Your user account or License Keys.

Subject to and conditioned upon compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the limitations, conditions, restrictions and obligations set forth below, Pair hereby grants to You a personal, non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable (except as expressly provided in SubSection (ii) below), non-transferable, revocable, limited copyright license, during the term of this Agreement solely for the Permitted Use, to (i) download, install and use the Software in machine-readable (i.e. object code) form only, and (ii) distribute in object code form only the Pair Engine and the Pair vSLAM that are included in the Software, solely as such binary files are integrated into and used by each Developer Application in accordance with the Documentation and the terms of this Agreement.  
Documentation.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the limitations, conditions, restrictions and obligations set forth below, You may reproduce and use a reasonable number of copies of the Documentation on an internal basis only, and solely in support of Your Permitted Use of the Software, provided that You reproduce all copyright and other proprietary notices that are on the original copy of the Documentation.

Third Party Licenses. The Software may contain third party programs, including but not limited to software licensed under open source terms.  The license terms associated with those programs apply to Your use of them, and in some instances such programs cannot be used or further distributed without a license from the respective owner of such programs. You shall be solely responsible to (i) obtain, if necessary, a separate and independent license from such owner with respect to any such use and (ii) include all applicable license terms and notices in the Developer Application for third party programs contained in the Software that are distributed as part of the Developer Application.  The delivery of the Software does not convey a license, nor imply any rights, to use third party programs.  A separate and independent license for such use may be required and You shall be solely responsible to verify whether such license is needed in conjunction with Your use of such third party programs.

Additional Software.  Pair hereby reserves the right to provide or otherwise make available, at its discretion, additional software to You from time to time.  Any additional software or documentation that Pair provides to You by express reference to this Agreement will be considered to be part of the Software or Documentation, as the case may be, and subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement.  By accepting, possessing or using such additional software or documentation, which shall include without limitation any related plug-ins as we may directly or indirectly distribute as well as related web applications used to generate image resources, You agree that the terms of this Agreement will apply thereto. 

Pre-commercial Software Releases.  If the Software provided to You under this Agreement is designated by Pair as a pre-commercial release (indicated by terms such as “early access,” “alpha,” “beta,” “trial,” “draft”, “evaluation” or “labs”) then in lieu of the licenses granted to You above, but subject to any other executed agreement that You may have for the Software which grants additional or different rights or imposes additional or different restrictions, You shall only have the right under this Agreement to download and install the Software on a reasonable number of workstations for the internal and non-commercial evaluation of the Software.  You acknowledge that the Software is a prerelease or experimental version and is not at the level of performance and compatibility of a final product. The Software may not operate correctly and may be substantially modified prior to first commercial release, or may be withdrawn completely.  You will not do any significant development or testing using the Software, and any development You undertake is at Your sole risk, with the understanding that the Software may never be issued for commercial use. You shall not commercialize, distribute, publicly perform or publicly display any applications developed by You using the Software or any component thereof. If You desire other rights (such as the right to develop commercial products using the Software) You must use a commercial release of the Software.  The use license granted in this section expires when the Software is made available under full commercial terms which You accept or upon notice to You by Pair, whichever is earlier.

It is your responsibility to review this list with each new release.  In the event that Pair makes any Software available that contains material variances from what is set forth in this Section with respect to the collection, use, or management of “personal data” and/or “personally identifiable information” (as those terms are defined under applicable law), You will be required to consent to such variances before downloading the applicable Software.  If you do not consent to such variances, do not download the Software. You further understand and agree that Pair and/or its affiliates and service providers may collect and use Statistics: (a) to provide the Software and Services, (b) to improve and optimize the Software and Services for different hardware and software requirements on various consumer devices (commonly referred to as device fragmentation), (c) to facilitate the provision of new products, updates, enhancements, technologies, and other services, (d) to improve the Software, the Services, and other products, services and technologies of Pair or its affiliates, and for any business purpose if de-identified and/or anonymized.

All payments of amounts due to Pair Inc. which are not paid when due shall accrue late payment charges on the unpaid amount in the amount of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum amount allowable under applicable law, whichever is less, from the date due until the date paid in full, together with any accrued late payment charges.
