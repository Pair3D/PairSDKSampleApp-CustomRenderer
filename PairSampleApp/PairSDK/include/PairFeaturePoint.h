/*! Represents a visual feature detected and tracked by computer vision.

 Features are typically located at points in an image with strong visual contrast, such as corners. Such points typically correspond to fixed geometric points in the physical world. Most data in this class is defined relative to the most recently processed video frame, which is available in [PairSensorFusionData sampleBuffer].

 This identifier should be the same for a given feature when it is tracked or matched across frames, and globally unique for a given session of PairSensorFusion. Note that if a particular feature is not found in a frame, but is re-detected in a subsequent frame, a new id will be assigned. */
